During my senior year at FAST NUCES, I had the privilege of opting the elective DevOps taught by Saim Safdar, aka [@cloudnativeboy](http://twitter.com/cloudnativeboy), founder of [Cloud Native Islamabad](https://community.cncf.io/islamabad/). What I deemed to be a theoretical course about the fundamentals of Cloud Native turned out to be a semester long mentorship for the next phase of my career.

## The Course

The course outline was built around the huge technology stack that can be considered relevant to Cloud Native in a broader sense, however, this was a unique journey into said technologies.

The course started with an introduction to the DevOps toolkit, which included the widely popular tools, GitHub, Docker, Docker Compose, Podman, Kaniko and Kubernetes.

Along with learning how these tools differ, we experienced hands-on labs on how to utilise them to their full efficiency.

The major focus for the second half of the course was Kubernetes and its associated technologies. The Service Mesh, specifically Istio were advanced topics that we learned to fix solutions of how different parts or services of an application can share data with each other.

## Beyond The Course
As I said before, this course was not just an intro to DevOps or the Cloud Native; it was a guide to accelerate our careers. Theoretical knowledge of applications and technologies is not that hard to get, but mentorship and a guide for the future is something every prospective Computer Scientist should acquire.

### Marketing
A huge lesson associated with this course was learning to market ourselves. In a field as rapidly advancing as computing, a fresh graduate needs something to set himself apart from the rest of the flock. He must know how to showcase his knowledge besides the obvious Degree or Diploma.

Creating our personal portfolios on GitHub, LinkedIn and Medium was a lesson in showing ourselves and our thoughts to the world.

### Blogs
We were motivated to write blogs on the technologies we learn and use, to demonstrate what we have learnt. I had the honor of writing three blogs to document my journey in computing.

#### 1. [Hosting and Accessing a Linux VM on Digital Ocean](https://github.com/IbrahimBhatti/Hosting-and-Accessing-a-Linux-VM-on-Digital-Ocean)
A step-by-step guide to hosting a virtual machine on the lesser known cloud service provider, Digital Ocean

#### 2. [Building Containers without Dockerfiles](https://github.com/IbrahimBhatti/Building-Container-Images-without-Dockerfiles)
An overview of building containers without Dockerfiles, with a step-by-step guide of using Buildah to do the same

#### 3. [An Introduction to Meshery — The Cloud-Native Manager](https://github.com/IbrahimBhatti/An-Intro-to-Meshery)
An introduction to the service mesh and how Meshery creates solutions in that domain

## Kubernetes Community Days Pakistan

KCD Pakistan 2023 was probably the highlight of this course. KCD Pakistan was the first of its kind technical conference with exciting talks and plenty of opportunities to exchange and network. KCD Pakistan was aimed at developers, operations people, and all other IT professionals with an interest in cloud-native technologies

As President of FAST Computing Society, I had the honor of participating in this event as a local organizer. With speakers from all around the world, an audience from students from different universities and industries in Islamabad, this conference set the stepping stone for more of such events to come.

A huge part of the tech industry, that many graduates are too late to realize is the tech community. Networking and being part of such communities is a way to grow not only in a company but as an individual contributer to computing as a whole. This is the lesson I have taken and acted upon, to find people with similar interests and experiences and network.

Create Podcasts, Blogs, Forum posts. From having an audience of none, a person can grow to become an organizer of an event with 10+ international speakers and an audience of half a thousand.

## Conclusion
As stated in the introduction, the course DevOps turned out to be more than just a theoretical course. It was a journey into the Cloud Native Community, which I believe is something that I will be contributing more and more to soon. The experience of being part of organizing the first ever KCD Pakistan is a once ever opportunity, and I’m greater now to have been given the chance.
